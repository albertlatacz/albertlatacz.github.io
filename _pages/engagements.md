### ADVERT RETARGETING PLATFORM - VIBRANT MEDIA
_Nov 2009 – May 2010_

Established in 2000, Vibrant Media is a contextual media pioneer and leading provider of contextual video advertising. 
I was working on extending In-Text platform, that serves contextually relevant advertisements to over 100 million user 
world wide. The system was developed using JavaSE making use of NIO and concurrency framework and deployed onto 200 
Tomcat servers clustered in three geo-locations, backed by MicrosoftSQL/MySQL databases. I was responsible for 
implementing user retargeting module, which was used in behavioural profile analysis to improve revenue by retargeting 
delivery of campaigns at users with specific profile characteristics. Due to high load and aggressive time constraints 
on delivery of inventory, the project had been developed with particular emphasis on performance and thoroughly tested 
with unit, regression and performance test.

### MOBILE SPREAD BETTING PLATFORM - IG INDEX
_Jan 2008 – Nov 2009_

IG Index, founded in 1974, was the first financial spread betting company in Britain, and is today the leading operation 
of its type in the world. I was leading a team of 3 working on redesigning of dealing platform for mobile devices. The 
system consisted of three tiers: backend service, which interacted with core dealing services; standalone middleware 
server, which provided communication bridge for mobile devices, encryption and live price streaming; and frontend JavaME 
mobile clients. The backend service was implemented with EJBs, Spring and Hibernate backed by Oracle database and deployed 
onto Weblogic cluster. Middleware server was based on Spring, Jetty, Java Concurrency, JMX and integrated with proprietary 
price streaming server over JNI. I was also responsible for designing and implementing framework that will allow porting 
of existing mobile dealing application to NTT DoCoMo Java (Doja). The main tasks were implementing network protocol 
stack using sockets for client and server as well as developing UI bridge. The application has been successfully 
introduced as a part of FXOnline launch and covered more than 15% of clients.

I have successfully introduced elements of agile/XP within the team, which improved communication, code quality and 
delivery time. In order to increase code quality, we have followed test driven development (TDD), 
conducted frequent code reviews and pairing sessions. Additionally, I have implemented a set of integration and 
regression test domain specific language (DSL). Tests were executed during nightly regression build on continuous 
integration server and helped detecting several, critical issues prior release to production.

### TEXT RELAY SERVICE - DSPG TELECOM 
_Jul 2004 – Dec 2007_ 

{: .text-justify}
Established in 1988, DSPG is an ISO 9001 registered company specialising in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and 
telecommunication equipment. The main projects I worked on were Text Relay Service (TRS-1) and TexBox-ISDN. The TRS-1 
is a media relay service and was developed for BT TypeTalk to connect 150 operators providing media translation services 
for hearing or speech impaired clients. I was a responsible for developing server and clients that bridged different 
communication media, such as email, FAX, SMS, internet and mobile chat. The backend was designed using Spring, Hibernate 
backed by Jetty and MySQL database, communicating with ISDN stack via proprietary TCP/IP protocol. I have successfully 
integrated the service with third party SMS provider (HSL SMS), FAX and IMAP email services. As a frontend to the system 
I have implemented three clients: JavaSE/Swing based operator's terminal, JavaSE applet for internet chat and JavaME 
mobile client. Clients shared common communication protocol which was optimised for mobile communication. The TRS-1 
systems are currently used by TypeTalk in UK and relay services in Spain, New Zealand and US. The second project I 
worked on was TexBox-ISDN, which involved implementing JavaSE/Swing based operator's terminal as well as integrating 
C++ VOIP library for voice streaming. The TexBox ISDN systems are used by number of organizations including Transport 
for London, British Deaf Association, Westminster City Council, NHS Direct and National Rail Enquiries.
